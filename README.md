This plugin gives WordPress Admin Dashboard users the ability to add fillable PDF attachments to email messages and form submission responses of Contact Form 7.

If the PDF attachment has a PDF form, the plugin allows users to add fields to the Contact Form 7 form and/or link them to fields in the PDF.  The plugin also allows the attached PDF files to be embedded with images supplied by the Contact Form 7 form fields.  The filled PDF files can be saved on the web server.

When your website visitor submits your Contact Form 7 form, the form in the PDF file is filled with the form information, images are embedded and the resulting PDF file is attached to the Contact Form 7 email message. The resulting PDF file can also be downloaded by your website visitors if this option is enabled in your form's options.

An external web API (https://pdf.ninja) is used for filling PDF forms (free usage has limitations).  The "Enterprise Extension" plugin is available for purchase that enables the processing all PDF operations locally on your web server and disables the use of the external web API.

Requirements:
* PHP 5.2 or newer
* WordPress 4.8 or newer
* Contact Form 7 5.0 or newer
* IE 11 (or equivalent) or newer

Known problems:
* Some third party plugins break the functionality of this plugin (see a list below). Try troubleshooting the problem by disabling likely plugins that may cause issues, such as plugins that modify WordPress or Contact Form 7 in radical ways.
* Some image optimization plugins optimize PDFs and strip PDF forms from PDF files. This may cause your existing forms to break at a random point in the future (when PDF file cache times out at the API).
* Multi-select checkbox fields are not currently supported. Support is planned in the future.
* The old version of the API (v1) produces PDFs which may not render properly in some PDF readers and with some UTF-8 (non-latin) characters, checkboxes and radio buttons.
