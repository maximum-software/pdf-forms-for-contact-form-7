Build Contact Form 7 forms from PDF forms. Get PDFs auto-filled and attached to email messages and/or website responses on form submission.

== Description ==

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhcPZwDXlh8]

This plugin allows Contact Form 7 users to add PDF attachments filled with form submission data to email messages and responses of Contact Form 7.

If the PDF attachment has a PDF form, the plugin allows users to add fields to the Contact Form 7 form and/or link them to fields in the PDF. The plugin also allows the attached PDF files to be embedded with images supplied by Contact Form 7 form fields. The filled PDF files can be saved on the web server.

When your website visitor submits your Contact Form 7 form, the form in the PDF file is filled with CF7 form data, images are embedded and the resulting PDF file is attached to the Contact Form 7 email message. The resulting PDF file can also be downloaded by your website visitors if this option is enabled in your form's options. It is possible to save the resulting PDF file to your server's wp-content/uploads directory.

What makes this plugin special is its approach to preparing PDF files. It is not generating PDF documents from scratch. It modifies the original PDF document that was prepared using third party software and supplied to the plugin. This allows users the freedom to design exactly what they need and use their pre-existing documents.

An external web API (https://pdf.ninja) is used for filling PDF forms (free usage has limitations). The "Enterprise Extension" plugin is available for purchase that enables the processing all PDF operations locally on your web server and disables the use of the external web API.

Please see the [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/jy84xqnj0Zk) and the [documentation](https://pdfformsfiller.org/docs/cf7/) for detailed information.

Requirements:
 * PHP 5.2 or newer
 * WordPress 4.8 or newer
 * Contact Form 7 5.0 or newer
 * IE 11 (or equivalent) or newer

Known problems:
 * Some third party plugins may break the functionality of this plugin (see a list below). Try troubleshooting the problem by disabling likely plugins that may cause issues, such as plugins that modify WordPress or Contact Form 7 in radical ways.
 * Some image optimization plugins optimize PDFs and strip PDF forms from PDF files. This may cause your existing forms to break at a random point in the future (when PDF file cache times out at the API).
 * If you are still using the old version of the API (v1) or the old version of Enterprise Extension (v1), please note that resulting PDFs may not render properly in some PDF readers and with some UTF-8 (non-latin) characters, checkboxes and radio buttons.

Known incompatible plugins:
 * [Post SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-smtp/) (breaks PDF attachment to email messages)
 * [Imagify](https://wordpress.org/plugins/imagify/) (strips forms from PDF files)
 * [ShortPixel Image Optimizer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortpixel-image-optimiser/) (strips forms from PDF files)
 * [Live Preview for Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cf7-live-preview/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I get an error: "There was an error trying to send your message. Please try again later." =

Please check your server's email configuration. Please check to make sure your SPAM mitigation technique is not causing the problem (reCaptcha/Akismet/etc).

= Does this plugin allow my website users to edit PDF files? =

No. This plugin adds features to the [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7) interface in the WordPress Admin Panel only.

= Does this plugin require special software installation on the web server? =

No. The plugin uses core WordPress and CF7 features only. No special software or PHP extensions are needed. Working with PDF files is done through [Pdf.Ninja API](https://pdf.ninja). It is recommended to have a working SSL/TLS certificate validation with cURL. [Enterprise Extension](https://maximum.software/store/pdf-forms-filler-enterprise-extension-2/) is available if your business requirements prevent the use of a third party API.

= How are CF7 form fields mapped to PDF form fields? =

The field mapper tool allows you to map fields individually and, when needed, generate new CF7 fields on the fly. CF7 fields can be mapped to multiple PDF fields. Mappings can be associated with a specific PDF attachment or all PDF attachments. Field value mappings can also be created, allowing filled PDF fields to be filled with data that differs from the originally filled values.

= My fields are not getting filled, what is wrong? =

Make sure the mapping exists in the list of mappings and the field names match.

If you attached an updated PDF file and your mappings were associated with the old attachment ID then those mappings will be deleted and you will need to recreate them.

Sometimes PDF form fields have validation scripts which prevent value with an incorrect format to be filled in. Date PDF fields must be [formatted with the format mail-tag](https://contactform7.com/date-field/#Format_Date_Value_in_Mail).

= How do I update the attached PDF file without attaching a new version and losing attachment ID associated mappings and embeds? =

Try using the [Enable Media Replace plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/enable-media-replace/) to replace the PDF file in-place in the Media Library.

= My checkboxes and/or radio buttons are not getting filled, what is wrong? =

Make sure your PDF checkbox/radio field's exported value matches the value of the CF7 form's checkbox tag. Usually, it is "On" or "Yes". If you need to display a different value in the CF7 form, you will need to create a value mapping or use [pipes](https://contactform7.com/selectable-recipient-with-pipes/).

CF7 allows you to have multiselect checkboxes, however, PDFs can't have multiple values with checkbox fields. You either need to switch to using a listbox in your PDF or rename your checkboxes such that each has a unique name and then map them appropriately.

Some PDF viewers don't render checkboxes correctly in some PDF files. You may be able to solve this issue by recreating the PDF in a different PDF editor. If you are still using Pdf.Ninja API v1, switching to v2 may resolve your issue.

= How do I remove the watermark in the filled PDF files? =

Please see the [Pdf.Ninja API website](https://pdf.ninja) and the [Enterprise Extension plugin page](https://maximum.software/store/pdf-forms-filler-enterprise-extension-2/).

= How do I set up PDF form filling on my local web server? =

Please see the [Enterprise Extension plugin page](https://maximum.software/store/pdf-forms-filler-enterprise-extension-2/).
